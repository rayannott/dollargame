# The Dollar Game
A graph-based single-player game inspired by one [Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/U33dsEcKgeQ).
## Description
 A given game is represented by a [connected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)) consisting of nodes (people) and edges (connections).\
Let two people having a connection be called _neigbours_. Each node (person) in this network has a value (some integer amount of money). 

## Actions
Every person can perform two actions:
- <b>give</b>: reduce its own value by a number of its neighbours and increase each of those neigbours' values by one;
- <b>take</b>: vice versa.


## Objective
By executing a sequence of actions with the least possible length distribute money in the network in such a way that no person has debt (a negative value).
